# Create Components

This document contains instructions on how to contribute components to the MAMMOth catalogue 
so that they are included in the namesake fairness toolkit. Modules depend on the
MAMMOTH-commons library to work with its various file types. To contribute to the main
library (for example, to add data types) see [here](../mammoth-commons/README.md).

**The catalogue may be hosted in a different repository in the future.**

1. [Set things up](#set-things-up)
2. [Write a new component](#write-a-new-component)
3. [Locally test a component](#locally-test-a-component)
4. [Build and upload a component](#build-and-upload-a-component)

## Set things up

**Installation:** Install the latest version of `MAMMOth-commons`
and the `docker` package in your virtual environment:

```bash
pip install --upgrade MAMMOth-commons
pip install docker
```

**New account:** You also need to create an account in
[DockerHub](!https://hub.docker.com/) or any other online
hosting service for docker images. You can ignore this step
while developing or testing components.

**Required tools:** Finally, download, install, and run Decker Desktop
from [here](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/). Command 
line instructions will use this to build docker images locally
before uploading them to the hosting service.

## Write a new component

You need to have set everything up as above to build and
deploy your MAMMOth components. Follow these steps
to write a component:

**Dependencies:** Import the necessary dataset or model classes
from the `mammoth.datasets`
and `mammoth.models` namespace respectively. 
Use them to annotate your method's argument
and return types. *Type annotations are mandatory for 
datasets and models.*

**Parameters:** You may also add string or numeric keyword arguments that serve
as parameters with default values. These don't require annotation. Don't forget to create a docstring for your component. 

**Decorators:** Decorate your component with either the 
`@mammoth.integration.metric(namespace, version, python="3.11")` or 
the `@mammoth.integration.loader(namespace, version, python="3.11")` decorator. 
These require at least one argument to denote
the component's version. The namespace refers to whom the component
should be accredited to and should be the same as your DockerHub 
username.

Here are some examples of components:

<details>
<summary>Example metric</summary>

```python
from mammoth.datasets import CSV
from mammoth.models import ONNX
from mammoth.exports import Markdown
from typing import Dict, List
from mammoth.integration import metric


@metric(namespace="...", version="v001", python="3.11")
def new_metric(
    dataset: CSV,
    model: ONNX,
    sensitive: List[str],
    parameters: Dict[str, any] = None,
) -> Markdown:
    """Write your metric's description here.
    """
    return Markdown("#Results\nThese are the results.")

```
</details>


<details>
<summary>Example dataset loader</summary>

```python
from mammoth.datasets import CSV
from mammoth.integration import loader

@loader(namespace="...", version="v001", python="3.11")
def data_csv_loader(
    path: str,
    delimiter: str = ",",
) -> CSV:
    """This is a CSV loader.
    """
    # load from path given delimiter or other arguments
    return CSV(
        ...  # add arguments here
    )
```
</details>


<details>
<summary>Example model loader</summary>

```python
from mammoth.models import ONNX
from mammoth.integration import loader

@loader(namespace="...", version="v001", python="3.11")
def model_onnx(
    path: str
) -> ONNX:
    """This is an ONNX loader.
    """
    return ONNX(path)

```
</details>

## Locally test a component

After decorating a component, you will want to test that it
runs correctly before uploading it for public consumption.
To write tests that
verify but then ignore your decorators to run on local data, 
create a context from which you can access the undecorated methods 
like so:

```Python
import mammoth
from components import dataloader, modelloader, metric  # import your components here

with mammoth.testing.Env(dataloader, modelloader, metric) as env:
    data = env.dataloader("data_url", data_kwarg1=..., data_kwarg2=..., ...)
    model = env.dataloader("model_url", model_kwarg1=..., model_kwarg2=..., ...)
    sensitive = ["attr1", "attr2", ...]  # list of sensitive attributes
    result = env.metric(data, model, sensitive, metric_kwarg1=..., metric_kwarg2=..., ...) 
    print(result.text)
```


## Build and upload a component

Don't forget to set the correct component version first (if you reuse 
a previously uploaded version, the toolkit may not be able to see the change).
Then, [login to your docker account](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/login/).
For example, in the simplest case where you want to host your component
in DockerHub, it suffices to run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
docker login
```

This will ask for your DockerHub username (if you are not part of
a team in DockerHub, this should be the same as your namespace) 
and password. This way, your terminal will have
permission to push the created docker images there. 

Also make
sure that the library is visible to your virtual environment by calling
in the top level (from where you can access subdirecories 
*mammoth/*, *catalogue/*, *tests/*, etc)

```bash
pip install -e .
```


Finally, create and upload a component by running the following
command (kfp is installed alongside MAMMOth-commons):

```bash
kfp component build . --component-filepattern catalogue/fairbench/modelcard.py 
```

In this, replace the `test_components/metric.py` with any other path
that contains the Python file in which you implemented your component. 

If you do *not* want to push the created docker image, for
example to run your new component in a local copy of the MAMMOth
bias toolkit without logging in and uploading it to DockerHub, run
this instead:

```bash
kfp component build . --component-filepattern catalogue/fairbench/modelcard.py --no-push-image
````

:warning: The build should be called from a directory where both your
component and virtual environment are subdirectories.
